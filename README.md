# Flower Spirals Visualization by GPT4

This project is an interactive visualization of flower spirals inspired by the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle. It allows users to control the speed of flower appearance and the number of petals on each flower.

## Features

- Multiple flower spirals appear on the screen, following the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle.
- Spirals appear in random positions on the screen.
- Flower appearance speed and petal count are controlled by sliders.
- Three spirals are displayed when the visualization is first opened.

## Usage

To use the visualization, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Controls

- Time Slider: Adjust the speed of flower appearance. Move the slider to the left to increase the speed and to the right to decrease the speed.
- Petal Slider: Adjust the number of petals on each flower. Move the slider to the left to decrease the number of petals and to the right to increase the number of petals.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the visualization.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the visualization.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file containing the code for the visualization and interaction.
